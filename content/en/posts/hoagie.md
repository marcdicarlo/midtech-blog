No-nonsense hoagie roll recipe based on [this one](https://www.cookwell.com/recipe/hoagie-rolls) from Ethan Chlebowski. Adjusted for Colorado mountain altitude and drynessâ€”because baking up here is a whole different game. I basically doubled the oil content to fight off the dry air.

Planning to try this with shortening instead of oil next time, just to see how it holds up. ðŸ§ª

## Ingredients

```yaml
milk: 260g
yeast: 8g
diastatic malt powder: 8g
flour: 400g
honey: 10g
sugar: 5g
olive oil: 40g
salt: 8g
```

## Prep ðŸ§‚

- Mix and knead until smooth and elastic.
- Divide the dough into 4 equal parts.
- Roll each piece flat, then shape into tight tubes (like little baguettes).
- Let rise until puffy and ready to bake.

## Bake

- Bake at 375Â°F for 20 minutes.
- Rotate halfway through.
- Egg wash optional (for shine).
- Steam optional (for crust).

These come out soft with just enough chewâ€”perfect for meatball subs or Philly cheesesteaks. ðŸ‘Œ
